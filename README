This repository contains some convenient functions for creating and using submodules.

If all functionality is required, this directory can be included with:

add_subdirectory(ITKHelpers/CMakeHelpers)

However, sometimes this is confusing and against CMake rules if CMakeHelpers is used from Child/ and also from Parent/ (as add_subdirectory(Child/CMakeHelpers) ). Instead, we can directly include() the .cmake files from Parent/CMakeLists.txt
include(Child/UseSubmodule.cmake)
